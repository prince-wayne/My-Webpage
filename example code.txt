example code

cards has five elements always
    - img
    - {titlelink}
    - date 
    - tags
    - desrciption

const start =       '<div class = "card"> /n '
let card.img =        '<img class = "card-img" src = " + img + '>'
let card.title =     '<h4> <a href = ' + link + '> ' +  title + ' </a> </h4> /n'
let card.date =       '<h4 class = "card-date"></h4>'
let card.tags =       '<h4 class = "card-tags"> </h4>' // will likely be a horizontal list
let card.description = <p class = "card-description"></p>


</div> "


path one: i make empty cards to later be filled with another function
    step one - 
        x for loop that counts to desired number
        x creates card elements upto number specified
        - create the content for these cards
        - fill the card content with the apporate content indexed correctly
        - make this scrollable through buttons (next btn change 1-6 to 7-12)
        
styling - we could either use js to set classes whenever a btn is pressed that are already styled or we can use js to change the style based on what bt is pressed.
